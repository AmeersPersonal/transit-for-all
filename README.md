# transit-for-all

# This is a mobile app that is designed to provide easy accessibility to the disabled and those in need. Current Transit apps provide the time that a train will arrive, however, it is not 
# easy to find information on accessibility, like an available elevator or escalator. This app (prototype) prioritizes accessibility by the user only being a click away from seeing accessibility status from the 5 nearest stations to them.
